# Content Expectations - Exercises

## Introduction
In this lesson, you'll complete some Jupyter Notebook and README content exercises.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

- Review the minimum expectations of written data science project
- List what enhances a project from the minimum to the exceptional
- Compare the impact of rewritten sections to their original content


## Jupyter Notebook Exercise 1

- Fully documented decision-making process
- Justification for decisions
- Considerations when choosing the metrics used
- Inclusion of cross-validation, used correctly

## README Exercise

Examine the README [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-postgrad_Project-Repository/blob/master/README.md) and identify which of these aspects is missing or incomplete (could be more than one):

- Detailed description of the business question
- Summary of the data science process, findings, and ideas for future improvement
- At least one interesting visualization
- Repository navigation 
- Links to the presentation slides, notebook, and other relevant documentation
- Links to sources, such as the data, papers referenced, or other important material
- Reproduction instructions
- Contact information

You can explore a more polished version of the same project repository [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-postgrad_House-Price-Prediction) in order to see what changed from the examples we provided in the exercises above.

## Summary

Great! Let's now apply this all to your own work!
